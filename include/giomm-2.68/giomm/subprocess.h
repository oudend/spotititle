/** Child processes.
 *
 * %Gio::Subprocess allows the creation of and interaction with child
 * processes.
 *
 * Processes can be communicated with using standard GIO-style APIs
 * (Gio::InputStream, Gio::OutputStream). There are GIO-style APIs to wait for
 * process termination (cancellable and with an asynchronous variant).
 *
 * There is an API to force a process to terminate, as well as a
 * race-free API for sending UNIX signals to a subprocess.
 *
 * One major advantage that GIO brings over the core GLib library is
 * comprehensive API for asynchronous I/O, such as
 * Gio::OutputStream::splice_async(). This makes %Gio::Subprocess
 * significantly more powerful and flexible than equivalent APIs in
 * some other languages such as the `subprocess.py`
 * included with Python. For example, using %Gio::Subprocess one could
 * create two child processes, reading standard output from the first,
 * processing it, and writing to the input stream of the second, all
 * without blocking the main loop.
 *
 * A powerful communicate() API is provided similar to the
 * `%communicate()` method of `subprocess.py`. This enables very easy
 * interaction with a subprocess that has been opened with pipes.
 *
 * %Gio::Subprocess defaults to tight control over the file descriptors open
 * in the child process, avoiding dangling-fd issues that are caused by
 * a simple fork()/exec(). The only open file descriptors in the
 * spawned process are ones that were explicitly specified by the
 * %Gio::Subprocess API (unless Gio::Subprocess::Flags::INHERIT_FDS was
 * specified).
 *
 * %Gio::Subprocess will quickly reap all child processes as they exit,
 * avoiding "zombie processes" remaining around for long periods of
 * time. wait() can be used to wait for this to happen,
 * but it will happen even without the call being explicitly made.
 *
 * As a matter of principle, %Gio::Subprocess has no API that accepts
 * shell-style space-separated strings. It will, however, match the
 * typical shell behaviour of searching the PATH for executables that do
 * not contain a directory separator in their name. By default, the `PATH`
 * of the current process is used. You can specify
 * Gio::Subprocess::Flags::SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP to use the `PATH` of the
 * launcher environment instead.
 *
 * %Gio::Subprocess attempts to have a very simple API for most uses (ie:
 * spawning a subprocess with arguments and support for most typical
 * kinds of input and output redirection). See create(). The
 * Gio::SubprocessLauncher API is provided for more complicated cases
 * (advanced types of redirection, environment variable manipulation,
 * change of working directory, child setup functions, etc).
 *
 * A typical use of %Gio::Subprocess will involve calling create(), followed by
 * wait_async() or wait(). After the process exits, the status can be
 * checked using functions such as get_if_exited() (which are similar to
 * the familiar WIFEXITED-style POSIX macros).
